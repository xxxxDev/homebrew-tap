  caveats <<~EOS
    Castpane is signed with the project's own certificate and is not notarized by Apple.
    This cask removes the download's quarantine flag, so it opens without "Open Anyway".
    On first launch its setup assistant asks for Screen Recording and Accessibility; they
    stay granted across updates. Castpane updates itself (Settings › General).
